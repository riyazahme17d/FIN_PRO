Here's a summary of the reconciliation:

**Summary Table:**

| Category             | Count |
|----------------------|-------|
| Total ERP Records    | 5     |
| Total Bank Records   | 5     |
| Missing in ERP       | 0     |
| Missing in Bank      | 0     |
| Amount Mismatches    | 1     |
| Exact Matches        | 4     |


**Reconciliation Rate:** 80.00%

The previous calculation was incorrect because it didn't account for the fact that some transactions are matched exactly.  The correct calculation is (Number of exact matches / Total number of transactions).  In this case, there are 5 transactions in each dataset, and 4 exact matches.  Therefore, the reconciliation rate is (4/5) * 100 = 80%.
